# In Memory Of (v1)

A gentle web app for paying tribute to a loved one. Upload a photo, write a short message, and preserve the memory in a quiet, respectful space.

## 🌿 What’s in v1

This version is the starting one. The functionality is not yet there i.e. the save function saves only the image and not the tribute. The css is minimal.

## 🧠 Endgame features

- Upload a photo of your loved one
- Write a brief tribute or message
- See a preview of your tribute
- Save the tribute as a PNG image (with clean layout)
- Mobile-friendly design
- Easy reset to create another tribute
